        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a recipe I learned from my grandmother. It's sweet and has a lighter texture than most sweet potato pies.</p>
        <p>Sweet potato pies are the perfect desert for the holidays.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>2 sweet potatoes</li>
            <li>1/2 a can of sweet condensed milk</li>
            <li>2 cups of sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of melted pure butter</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons of flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons of vanilla extract</li>

            <li>2 teaspoons of allspice</li>
            <li>1 unbaked deep dish pie crust</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>

            <li>Peel the potatoes and mash them with a pototo masher or mixer.</li>
            <li>Add the mashed potatoes, milk, sugar, butter, eggs, flour, vanilla, nutmeg, and allspice together in a bowl and mix them with a mixer.</li>
            <li>Add the mixture to the pie crust.</li>
            <li>Bake the pie in a preheated oven for 45 to 50 minutes or until the crust is brown.</li>
